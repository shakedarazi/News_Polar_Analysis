# 📌 docs/ — Project Documentation (Source of Truth)

This folder is the single source of truth for the project's design, contracts, and decisions.

## Rule

Code, Airflow DAGs, and SQL must be derived from the documents in this folder — never the other way around.

Any change that affects determinism, schemas, IDs, algorithms, or metrics must be documented here first.

## 🧩 What Each Section Is Responsible For

### architecture/

Explains system-level design decisions:

- Why the pipeline is batch-oriented and not streaming
- Why the system uses two DAGs
- Why article text and audience comments are separated
- Deterministic constraints at the architectural level

### contracts/

Defines the hard contract of the system:

- Core entities and their meaning (Article, Window, Comment)
- Identification and primary keys
- Versioning rules
- Data Quality rules

> ⚠️ Any change here may break reproducibility and downstream analysis.

### pipelines/

Defines the operational behavior:

- DAG 1 (Ingestion): what it does and what it does not do
- DAG 2 (Snapshot + Processing): lifecycle and responsibilities
- Staging to BigQuery load and MERGE semantics

### algorithms/

Defines the exact algorithms used by the system:

- Article window segmentation and feature extraction
- Comment scoring and like-weight logic
- Aggregation logic (weighted mean and weighted p85)

### schemas/

Defines the field-level structure of data:

- Raw JSON stored in GCS
- Snapshot JSON with comments
- Staging Parquet schemas
- Final BigQuery tables and keys

### lexicon/

Defines the lexicon strategy:

- Baseline approach: Expanded Lexicon (Approach A)
- Offline expansion rules and constraints
- Future option: Prefix stripping (Approach B), not enabled

### diagrams/

Contains Mermaid diagram files that visualize:

- End-to-end dataflow
- GCS folder layout
- Staging to BigQuery and MERGE
- Concurrency model

---

## 🚀 Authoritative Order of Work

1. Update documentation in docs/
2. Implement application code
3. Implement Airflow DAGs
4. Implement BigQuery SQL
5. Validate outputs against Data Quality rules

---

## ⚠️ Determinism and Reproducibility Requirements

The system must guarantee:

- Same input produces the same output
- No non-deterministic behavior in the critical path

Every output record is tagged with:

- pipeline_version
- lexicon_version
- comment_lexicon_version
- run_id
