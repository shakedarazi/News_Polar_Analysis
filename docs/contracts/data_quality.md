Data Quality Rules and Validation Constraints

This document defines mandatory data quality rules that must hold for all computed outputs.
These rules ensure correctness, consistency, and analytical reliability.

Purpose of Data Quality Rules

Data quality rules exist to:

Detect corrupted or partial outputs

Prevent silent logical errors

Enforce assumptions made by the analysis

Enable safe downstream querying

Violations must be detectable automatically.

Window-Level Quality Rules

Each article window must satisfy the following constraints:

window_len must be greater than 0

window_len must be an integer

counts per category must be non-negative integers

sum of category counts must be less than or equal to window_len

If a window contains no category matches:

cat_words equals 0

dominance must be NULL

If a window contains category matches:

dominance must be between 0 and 1 inclusive

Category Consistency Rules

For each window:

active must equal the number of categories with count greater than 0

present_mask must reflect exactly the same active categories

present_mask must be consistent with counts vector

Any mismatch indicates a computation defect.

Comment-Level Quality Rules

Each comment feature must satisfy:

comment_len must be greater than 0

polar_count must be between 0 and comment_len

polar_ratio must be between 0 and 1 inclusive

like_count must be greater than or equal to 0

like_weight must be greater than or equal to 1

comment_score must equal polar_ratio exactly.

Article-Level Aggregate Rules

For each article aggregate:

num_comments must be greater than or equal to 0

sum_like_weight must be greater than or equal to num_comments

audience_mean must be between 0 and 1 inclusive, or NULL if num_comments is 0

audience_p85 must be between 0 and 1 inclusive, or NULL if num_comments is 0

If num_comments equals 0:

audience_mean must be NULL

audience_p85 must be NULL

Cardinality Expectations

Expected ranges are used as warnings, not hard failures:

num_comments should not exceed 200

number of windows per article should be within reasonable bounds relative to article length

Exceeding these thresholds triggers warnings for manual inspection.

Referential Integrity Rules

The following relationships must always hold:

Every window references a valid article_id

Every comment feature references a valid article_id

Every aggregate references a valid article_id

Missing references indicate incomplete ingestion or processing failure.

Versioning Completeness Rules

Every computed row must include:

pipeline_version

lexicon_version (or comment_lexicon_version)

run_id

Missing version fields are considered critical errors.

Immutability Expectations

Once data passes validation and is written to final storage:

Rows must not be updated in place

Corrections require a new run_id

Historical data must remain intact

Handling of Violations

If a data quality violation is detected:

The affected article or run must be flagged

Partial outputs must not be merged into final tables

The run may be retried safely after correction

Data Quality as a Contract

Data quality rules are part of the system contract.

Any change to algorithms or schemas that invalidates these rules must:

Be explicitly documented

Introduce new versions

Preserve backward compatibility where possible
